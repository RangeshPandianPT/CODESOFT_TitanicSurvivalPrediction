🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction

This project uses the famous Titanic dataset to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster or not. It’s a classic beginner-friendly data science project that demonstrates data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
